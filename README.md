# MIS 320 Final Project

This repository contains the code for the final project of MIS 320 for the Fall
2019 semester at Iowa State University (ISU).

Although this repository was created ~3 weeks before the project was due, the
majority of it was completed in a single night. Knowing that, please take the
code quality with a grain of salt. That being said, overall I think things came
out pretty well. Nothing really is awful at the very least and this provides a
very good basis for a simple Spring/Angular project utilizing Oracle (blegh) as
a backend.

All code in this project is totally free to use in any other project without
credit, regardless of its license. Have at it.
